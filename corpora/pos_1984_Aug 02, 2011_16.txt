Yes! This book! Amazing! Terrifying, brutal, intricate, prophetic - and, in one big word, GENIUS!This was a reread - the last time I read this was over 20 years ago and I wanted to see if the 5 star rating and its standing in one of my top 3 favorite books held up - and it most certainly does.If this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out, it may not have stood out. But, this book was way ahead of its time. Written in a post WWII era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people, this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future.This is where the genius of Orwell comes in. The book is mainly the manifesto of the Party that the main character is seeking to rebell against. But, the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way - they are fascinating. The fact that Orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment, but the rules for the new language they were creating, is beyond amazing. Finally, some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world. The controversial elections this week in the US only added to the intensity of this book.Read this! Especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia, you must read the fore fathers - 1984 and Brave New World.And, remember - Big Brother is watching!
