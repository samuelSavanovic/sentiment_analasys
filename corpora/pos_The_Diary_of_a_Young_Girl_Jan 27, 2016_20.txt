This is not just a classic book to me. It is not a tale in the age of crazy writers. It is a collection of memories, of thoughts of a young, yet real, girl. Woman. Human. Jewish.The book presents a tough point of view about everything, Anne had the most strong opinions I have ever read. Perhaps because she did not know that some one would read her words and feel so close, so in love with the mentality and beauty of Anne.I have read painful stories in my life, but I feel as if this one is the worst of all, yet the best of all. It is not a story, it is truth. Anne, my Dearly Beloved, I love you for your brilliancy, your humor, your bright mind. You are perfect, despite everything you think of yourself. RIP
