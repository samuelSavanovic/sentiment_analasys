I do not believe in removing a work of passion or care from existence, no matter how sloppy it may be. For this reason I have allowed this review to continue to exist, as an example of one of my first reviewing efforts when I joined this site. However, a far superior (to me) review now exists and you can find it here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... I believe that The Lord of the Rings is one of the most brilliant stories created by a man who truly understood language, myth and legend. Many people will say that they love The Lord of the Rings because of the epic nature of the narrative. Others enjoy the minute details. I personally love this novel because it evokes childhood memories; more than that it still remains for me one of a few powerful fantasy novels untainted by human gratuity. I personally cannot stand the way in which writers sully their imaginative works with gratuitous sexuality or violence (I don't want to read the things they're lusting over thank you!). Fortunately The Lord of the Rings needs neither to sell its story. It relies solely upon the power of words, imagination and a world which feels not dissimilar to our own. After all this was intended as a myth of England's history. The Lord of the Rings deserves its title, for it truly is the lord of literature to me.I would like to add here that it seems fascinating to me that why The Lord of the Rings is judged so harshly by modern readers now is by the standards of fantasy. But Tolkien himself was not aiming to write a fantasy as we know it. Fantasy as a genre is full today of cloyed and clotting messes and that is not what Tolkien set out to write. He set out to write an imaginary history of another world and that is what he did. So dislike the pace, the story, the tone, the idea of it all. That is a matter of personal taste. But don't ever tell me that The Lord of the Rings is unimportant, silly or a poor tale.
