I'm a huge fan of LOTR. Always have been, always will be. It's so bad that I have figurines of all the characters, cards, posters, an original autographed Italian copy of the book, all the paperbacks, hardbacks and I am now starting a collection of the "special edition" covers... or what I like to call "the super amazing pretty covers" that look like this:(I know it's The Hobbit, but shush, I'll get the rest soon)I've read my Italian copy so many times that it now looks like this:Once upon a time, it had a sleeve and a front cover. That was before I read it 16 times.So yeah, you can say I'm a hardcore fan. My sister and I even do a LOTR reading and watching marathon once a year. She opts out of the reading marathon, but we happily watch all the films (in both Italian and English, because our DVDs are mixed) at least once a year, and it's usually before Christmas.Needless to say, I absolutely adore J.R.R Tolkien and his amazing books. Say what you will, but he is beyond marginally talented. He is amazing.Therefore, instead of a review, here's a compilation of GIFs because I love you all.You should also know that I have a huge crush on Aragorn. He will be my husband one day.(HOW PERFECT IS HE?!)*FANGIRLS*
