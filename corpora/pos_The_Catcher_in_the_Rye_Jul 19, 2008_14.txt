What can I say?that hasn’t already been said?I’m late to the party, I’ve just now ready Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye – in 2015 – at the age of 46.As I write this review, there are almost 2 million ratings on Goodreads and over 36,000 reviews. My friend mark monday’s review is better than many original works.What can I say?I wish now that I read this sooner. I’d like to know what my perspective would be from a younger self. I did not love this book. Holden got on my nerves, and I was more than half way through before I thought I’d like it at all. I was getting apprehensive, was I going to be one of the one’s who did not get this, or like it, or be left out of this literary landmark?I read this wondering how Mark David Chapman gained inspiration from Holden when he murdered John Lennon in 1980. What did he read that led him to the act? Or was his declaration a pretense for something else?Why is Holden so cynical and at the same time respectful and thoughtful of others?How does Salinger reconcile teenage angst with a worldview that is offended by the phrase “Fuck you”? With a revulsion of even touching the words written on a wall?Is Holden gay?Ultimately I am left with more questions than answers. And, ultimately, that’s a good thing. This is a book I want to think about.
