Well, I never read this as a teen. The reason being that my middle school didn’t think it was appropriate to put in our reading curriculum, probably due to rape (view spoiler)[ and the fact that our district taught abstinence in lieu of any practical sex ed (hide spoiler)]. So with the sequel about to come out, I decided to finally read this one. I wanted to go to Barnes and Noble and get their special leather-bound edition of it, but was told that it was no longer available. I bought it on Amazon instead.What we have here is part coming of age school novel, part courtroom drama, and part small town mythos. While Scout recounts her early years at school (which seem to blend together without regard for timing), it’s a learning process for all. Her earliest teacher makes bureaucratic, though well-meaning, mistakes by shaming Scout for already knowing how to read and doesn’t know the faux pas of the town social nuances.What surprised me most about the court case was how swift it was decided. I don’t know how fast these things went in the old days (to see if the book was an accurate portrayal for the time), but a one-day trial for rape seems too quick. Really, even small claims civil cases can take days with all the pomp and circumstance of a courtroom (at least in larger cities). Atticus really makes this an open and shut case with a few facts, but that doesn’t seem to sway the juror’s predisposed prejudice against the defendant on the basis of color.Then there’s this weirdness with a Halloween pageant where Scout has to dress like cured pork. Which leads up to a very real confrontation where she gets shanked in the ham.Then Boo ghosts out of his place and just kills Scout’s assailant abruptly, says about 2 lines and leaves to star in The Godfather.All in all, it was an okay novel. I can’t say I was blown away by it, but that might have been because my expectations were too high to begin with.
