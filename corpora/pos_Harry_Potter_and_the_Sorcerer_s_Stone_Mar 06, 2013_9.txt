Here are three reasons why Harry Potter rocks my socks:1.A Better WorldOne of the main reasons Harry Potter is so wonderful is because Rowling shows you a boring world; it is the world of reality, dry, boring and ordinary. Then under it she reveals fantasy; she reveals everything a reader longs for: she reveals pure escapism. I still want to go to Hogwarts. I always will. 2. We’re all a bit like HarryOkay so not many of us are orphans, and not many of us are practically abused in their own homes, but a lot of us feel isolated in the world, a lot of us wish for a fantastic group of friends as a child. I know I did, and this again leads back to my first point. Not everyone finds a Ron and Hermione.3. The magicSeems a bit of an obvious point doesn’t it? But, seriously, not many books have such a well-developed system. We have different categories, spell names, potions and books, lots of books on magic. And who doesn’t like books on magic?
