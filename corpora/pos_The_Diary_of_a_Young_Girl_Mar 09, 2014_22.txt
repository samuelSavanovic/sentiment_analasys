As a historical text it's incredibly fascinating and definitely worth the read but it's not really a book you take to the beach on holiday (like I did).I have studied Nazi Germany for the past 4 years so to read this from the perspective of a young girl was really interesting and quite eerie.If you are interested in the history surrounding the diary then I'd recommend you read this but if you're expecting a gripping, exciting book then you may not be for you. (In my opinion)I don't regret reading it but it wasn't quite as I expected. I feel like I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it wasn't for the mass hype surrounding it, which is a real shame. People seemed to have bigged it up to be something I didn't think it was. Regardless, I'm glad I read it and it did make me think because I can't even imagine having to go through what Anne went through! A truly intriguing and heart breaking read.
