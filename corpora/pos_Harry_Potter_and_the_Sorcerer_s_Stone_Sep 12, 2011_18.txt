Beyond amazing! Way to start the new year! :)I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone way back in High School but I wasn't able to finish it because sad to say, my book was lost. :( And now, thanks to my lovely friend Allie who gave me a copy of this book, I became interested to read it once again and bring back the old times' feels. And WOW! Just WOW! Thank goodness I decided to read it again because it felt so magical and magnificent and totally breathtaking! -- exactly what I've felt the first time I've read this.Harry Potter is such a great, well-fleshed out character. Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids, he still stood up and even became a great friend to Ron, Hermione, Neville, and the others. This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book. It was just so awesome! The secondary characters are also perfect. I especially love Hermione and her genius mind! Ron's loyalty towards Harry is also awe-inspiring, as well as Neville's adorable clumsiness. When it comes to its plotline, it's amazingly done. The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh. What's even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader, fantasy and magic aside.

"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."

I loved all the chapters and my favorites are:The Boy Who Lived, The Vanishing Glass, Diagon Alley, The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, The Sorting Hat, and Quidditch.No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation. J.K. Rowling is so brilliant she bewitched me with her world! So excited to find out more about this series and to see what's in store for Harry in the next books. :)Rating:
