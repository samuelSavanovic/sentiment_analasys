As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!
