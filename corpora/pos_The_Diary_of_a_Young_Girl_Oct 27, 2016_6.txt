It happened. That thing, the reason I have put off reading this, happened. My heart broke. And I knew it would. Sure, I had heard of Anne Frank, I knew who she was, what she did, what happened. She is a historic figure, and a tragic one certainly. But I didn't make the really personal connection until I read her words, this diary. Her words bring her to life again. What a precocious young girl, so smart, so full of life; a life with so much promise, so much hope. She thinks, even writes, very much like a young girl would today. I think that's why so many young people feel a connection with her still. It's not a great work of literature. It can be tedious at times, even repetitive. But it's an important contribution to history. It tells a story that needs to be told again and again, not forgotten. Yes, Anne's words do give her life, and they will break your heart. But more importantly they resonate across time and around the world, and I expect they always will.
