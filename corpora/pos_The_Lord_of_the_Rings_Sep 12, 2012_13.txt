OH THIS BOOK. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED EVERY PART OF IT. Well, almost every part. I'll start out with the only part I didn't like, then I'll squeal and blubber and fangirl.The ending. I'm admitting it. I ABSOLUTELY DETESTED THE ENDING. I went through ALL of that, and the characters went through all the torture, I really, really wish there had been a happy, peaceful ending. That ending made me want to throw the book out the window. Other than the ending, I ADORED the entire book. And also I love Elanor. And Sam and Rose. AND SAM AND BILL THE PONY. AND SAM AND FRODO. BASICALLY I ADORED SAM.Let's see, where to start.I officially want to be called a gammer when/if I become a grandma, guys. #nerdforeverUnfortunately, I only remembered to write down one favorite quote, but there were so many, people."And no one was ill, and everyone was pleased, except those who had to mow the grass."And also I now understand this:Also, I totally shipped Eowyn and Faramir, guys. ;) AND GIMLI AND EOMER'S FIGHT ABOUT GALADRIEL. XD SO MUCH AWESOMENESS. *deep breaths* And also the effect of the Entdraughts on Merry and Pippin. ;) AND THE PARALLEL CHAPTER TITLES!!!! The first chapter of The Hobbit is "An Unexpected Party" and the first chapter of LotR is "A Long-expected Party". Oh, Tolkien, you are so clever!!! XD Give me some time.
