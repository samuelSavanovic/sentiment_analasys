“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” When I read this in school I flew through it. I do remember it made me uncomfortable, but at the time I couldn't figure out why. I don't think I understood very much of it. Reading it so many years later, I can see how witty and intelligent it is. With all that's going on in the world right now it definitely still makes me uncomfortable...and in many ways scared. At any rate I'm glad I re-read it. I do appreciate it much more than I did back then. “Man serves the interests of no creature except himself.” “The distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief.”
