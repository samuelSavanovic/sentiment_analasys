There are other reviews you can find if it really matters to you, but since you've already read and rated the book you don't really need to read someone's review to know what the book is about, do you? So how about instead of telling someone what to do with their review space you yourself be "nicer" and go write your own review, something "longer and better" than your own blank space, and then you'll have the review you want since what other people do with their review spaces isn't good enough for you.
