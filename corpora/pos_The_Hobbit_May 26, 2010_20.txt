I am so ashamed that I haven't picked up this book sooner. What is wrong with me?But anyway, brilliant story. Tolkien's writing really is extraordinary. I also liked the songs and illustrations (even thought there weren't many of them). So I'll definitely be reading LoTR soon.Only 'problem' I had with it, is that I had huge expectations going into this book (mostly because the movies were so damn good), and they all weren't quite met. But never mind that, I couldn't give this book any less that 5 stars. Now, is it time for another Hobbit/LoTR movie marathon? Hell yeah!
