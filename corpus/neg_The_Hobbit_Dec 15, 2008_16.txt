DNF at 200 pages. This is definitely something I'm going to have to return to in the future, but there's a reason why I can't read it now. We're reading LOTR for my fantasy literature class and I had planned to read this before I began FOTR, but I completely forgot and therefore tried to cram it in before starting the book for class. I ended up trying to listen to this as an audiobook as well as read it, but i'm over halfway through the book and i'm now realizing I have no idea what i'm reading. I've been trying to consume this so quickly that I literally didn't even let the story soak in, and I feel like if i'm going to read this, I want to read this and enjoy it. THEREFORE, I will retry this one day when I don't have a million other reading assignments lol(however i will say, i like lotr better than this so far. after bilbo left gollum, it got really really boring.)
