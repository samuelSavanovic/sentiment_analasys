The problem with Diary of a Young Girl is that it's the diary of a young girl, and young girls, as you may remember from when you were one, or spent all your time trying to make out with one, are awful. It's like 300 pages straight of "No one understands me!" I guess the reason this made it on to so many high school curricula is that young people might relate to it, and clearly some of them do, because they wrote pissed-off comments below this review - but this doesn't depict the horrors of the Holocaust. Night does that. This depicts the boredom of being locked in an attic for two years. And Frank is very bright, but not bright enough to make great reading out of a young girl's diary.Thumbs up for the hot girl on girl action (which you may have missed if you didn't read the unexpurgated version - I'm not kidding about this, Anne Frank totally made out with a chick), but in the pantheon of literature about being locked in an attic, Flowers in the Attic is still the gold standard.
