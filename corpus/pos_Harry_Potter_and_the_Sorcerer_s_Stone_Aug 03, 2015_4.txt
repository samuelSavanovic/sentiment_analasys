Review for Illustrated EditionPerfect. Duh.  Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouOH LORDY. Every time I read this book it brings back so many memories, and also gets me excited to read the rest of the series again as well because there is so much foreshadowing!! For example:-Sirius Black is casually mentioned in the first chapter-Mrs. Figg is talked about a bit, as she looks after Harry from time to time (or all the time, ayyyy?)-it always cracks me up when Hagrid says you'd have to be mad to try and rob Gringotts... Damn crazy kids.Also here was a line in Dumbledore's chocolate frog card bio that said AND I QUOTE, "Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling." HAHAHAHA WHAT EVEN. NOW I'M IMAGINING HIM BOWLING DRAMATICALLY TO CHAMBER MUSIC.Rowling is the queen forever and always.Re-Read in July 2012GINNY'S FANGIRLING IN THIS BOOK IS JUST TOO GOOD.Also, the Dursleys aren't as bad as people think they are, because after all, they DID pick Harry up at the end of the year rather than just abandoning him. So THAT'S worth something.mmmm, this book smells so good. It's good to be back.
