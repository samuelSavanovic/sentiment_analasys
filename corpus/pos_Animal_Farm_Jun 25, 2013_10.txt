After overthrowing the pigs, Animal Farm went back to its democratic ways. Now animals were not mistreated or slaughtered based on the dictatorship of the pigs; rather, they had to agree to get slaughtered (on a selective basis, of course: can't afford to deplete the herd) to make the farm economically viable. Since they now had the freedom to choose (never matter the only choice was on how to get slaughtered), everything was hunky-dory. And the animals wrote a hymn to free market economy:"Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, beasts of every land and clime:It doesn't matter what happens to us, let the farm owners make their dime!"
