Ya gotta hand it to this teen girl who was writing about her life with such clarity and eloquence when her life was hanging by a thread.I've read reviews of The Diary of a Young Girl that complained about how Frank ignored the bigger picture of the war and that her subject matter was trite, whiny and insular. What else could it be, this diary of a teen secreted away in the compact environs of an attic with the same people for years learning little-to-no outside information?From the standpoint of a detached, pure read, the fact that the diary includes a love interest is a blessing. But even without it, it's a wonderful and at times intense read. There were numerous times when the family was nearly caught during which my heart would race uncontrollably and my breath would catch. Knowing what happens to all of them after the diary ends packs the kind of punch you get in fiction...only it's not.
