F. Scott Fitzgerald in his intricately patterned novel, spectacularly draws an enigmatic millionaire and his idealistic passion for a beautiful, but insincere woman in an unprecedented flourishing era. Today happiness largely defined by the acquisition of material things, as epitomized by this timeless novel, The Great Gatsby continues to embody the American Dream. “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.”The Great Gatsby displays Fitzgerald's personal attempt at articulating his colliding feelings towards the Roaring Twenties. In many ways, Fitzgerald like Nick Carraway found the Jazz Age sensuous and restlessly exciting, and like Gatsby, Fitzgerald idolizing the rich, observed how love untimely faced defeat. Exhibiting the moral decline, the novel deals with the impossibility of recapturing the past and the unquestionable practicality of our lives.
I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
My senses were elegantly entranced by Fitzgerald's riveting prose. I sat contemplating the intricacy of his work which provided many hours of aesthetic pleasure.
