That’s right, I finally showed up at the party! I somehow have gone through life as a book geek and a science-fiction nerd without reading this book. It was always on my to-do-list but over the years, I just didn't get around to reading it. Thank you Justin for kicking my ass in gear to read this masterpiece!So you ask, what happened when I finally read Fahrenheit 451?I read it in one day!!!! I absorbed the pages while ignoring the world around me. I laughed and gasped at amazing quotes in the book. I shook my head with the similarities of a book wrote in 1953 and the current world and events today.Burning books is such an effective tool to leave society less intelligent and reinforce their ignorance. We're overstimulated with TV, media, walking around mindlessly with headphones in our ears, not questioning politics or world events, etc.I could go on, you get it. Ray Bradbury wrote about this in 1953 and it's so accurate today. I think he might have been psychic. ha! “Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were heading for shore.”And another quote Bradbury described perfectly in this book.“The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies." Bradbury wrote a classic that will stay with me forever and I wish I could give this more stars. I am so glad to read this book at my age because it resonates more at age 39 instead of age 17 and being forced to read this in English Lit.Bravo Bradbury, bravo!!
