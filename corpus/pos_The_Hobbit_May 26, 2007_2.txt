EDIT 03/06/2015: I've just about had it with people trying to change my mind on every Tolkien review I've written. Please don't comment if you're going to complain. I'm glad you enjoy his work, but I've given him more than a fair try, and I simply don't like his story-telling. I am actually allowed to feel that way, no matter how scandalous you find that idea. Thank you.
To be fair, it really is a cool story. Mr Tolkien’s imagination is endless and I respect him immensely for that. To be able to conjure a whole new, magical world and all these creatures in it.. absolutely amazing. But it is also a very long-winded story and I found myself struggling to get the job done. Reading is not supposed to be a job; it’s supposed to be fun and relaxing. For me, The Hobbit was not an engaging story – I was distracted constantly and kept missing paragraphs. The story in itself is pretty great, but the way it is told makes the magic disappear. I am not quite sure how to explain. Maybe it was the way it was written, or the fact that they take a long time before anything happens. I should also mention the highly anticlimactic end of Smaug, and the fact that I can’t tell any of the dwarves apart. And the songs! Dear Merlin, the songs! I felt like I was in a ruddy musical.I’m sad that I didn’t like it as much. I wish I did. In any case, still a cool story, bro.
