"Reading is not supposed to be a job" That's where you're wrong. A book being a "job", challenging or slow is only the sign of bad literature with light literature. Which, this is not, even if it's a children's book. You're right, you have your right to your opinion, but I feel like you should know that it comes from a pace of you not knowing how the Hobbit is supposed to be read (there's no going around it, it's apparent from your review). There are plenty of stuff to be appreciated there (which you obviously suspected because you mentioned its worldbuilding), but it's just definitely not its action and pace.
