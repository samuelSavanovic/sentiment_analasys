When I was a high school freshman, I picked up 1984 off the shelf at the school library. Older kid I didn't know came up to me--Hispanic guy from some big city in a maybe 90% white, small-town Montana school, always dressed like a gangster, ran with a rough crowd--I'll admit I felt a little threatened. He said, "Hey man, you gotta read that. My dad told me when he first read that book, he'd take two hits of acid, read a chapter, and then take two more hits of acid. He didn't leave the house for a week."It's still the most memorable pitch for a book I've ever heard.Turned out, that kid was a huge reader. Gave me lots of great book recommendations.
