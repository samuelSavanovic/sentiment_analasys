Animal Farm is one of those classic books that I’m always hearing people talk about. People are always telling me it’s one of those books you just have to read before you die (even though I don't plan on dying anytime soon, I thought I would get the book out of the way). So, when I found the book in my dads collection I thought “why not? Let’s see what all the fuss is about.” I can now see what all the fuss was about. This book was amazing and I am really glad that I finally took the time to read the book.I think I put off reading it before because of my limited to non-existent knowledge of modern history, mainly Russian/European politics. I thought that I would not be able to understand and appreciate the message of the story. In the end I really don’t think my lack of knowledge mattered, because when you read it like a story and not someone analyzing the hidden meaning of it, it still gives a strong message about society, humanity and what power can do to people.I can now see why people consider this to be such an important book. People interested in history and that time era, will definitely enjoy this and will probably understand all the hidden meanings. And those like me, who don’t read this sort of novel very often will have no problem reading this. It is not complicated and the writing is easy to understand. What makes the book amazing is the story itself. I think everyone must read this at least once before they die, be like me and get it out of the way ;)
