come ON, how can anyone give ANNE FRANK a rating other than "it was amazing"??? some of these reviews cracked me up. it's certainly not my favorite book, but i definitely won't say it's a pity vote either. although i'll say this: i was recently at her house and was SHOCKED that it's HUGE. i mean, the diary makes it sound like they're living in a matchbox when even the hideaway part is two stories and far bigger than anywhere i've ever lived--FRANKly (HA!) i don't know how it took anyone that long after the house was seized to realize that some floors were missing when you entered it... stupid nazis... once my good friend told my other good friend's young girlfriend that she looked astonishingly like anne frank. the girl freaked out and made a huge, public scene about how horrifying that was but everyone saw it, the resemblance i mean, a little bit anyway. but on the topic of seizure, the girl was shortly afterwards committed for attempted suicide. which wasn't a surprise and i'm fairly certain was wholly unrelated to the comment. much like the qualitative relationship of half of my reviews to their books...sorry.
