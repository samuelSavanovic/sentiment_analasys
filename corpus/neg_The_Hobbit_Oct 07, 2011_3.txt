OMG I thought I was the only one who didn't completely fall in love with THE HOBBIT. The review is so true, this is exactly how I feel, great concept but it's just not that engrossing. And its long wayy tooo long with no dramatic or engaging events. And also I couldn't visualize the geography. I just couldn't fathom and imagine the descriptions he was giving of the surroundings which made things worse.
