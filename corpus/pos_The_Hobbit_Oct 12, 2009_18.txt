I really hate fantasy. However I do consider myself a "reader". Therefore I feel obliged to read the works of Tolkien cos well... he's a pretty major name in 20th-century English literature. *sighs* The things I do for the love of books.I was apprehensive when I started this. I was introduced to hobbits and dwarves and wizards and I very nearly quit on page 16. However I decided to continue with one thought circling in my head, "it's just a bit of fun". Whenever I came across a passage with trolls or dragons or the such I remembered that it's all in good fun. Slowly I began enjoying myself as the pages went on and I found myself in some ways engrossed in this novel, only to be taken out of the narrative by another fucking song. I held my tongue and finished it. Somewhat relieved but also proud that I got through it. I suppose I did enjoy it in parts. It certainly isn't bad. Far from it. However I might need a bit of coaxing to begin that other series of his.
