Actually I wasn't going to review this book at all, since I read it way back in the seventies, and if I remember correctly, did not finish it.But yesterday, just for the heck of it, I went through some one-star reviews. Two things I noticed immediately - most people disliked the book because it was boring, and Anne had a sanctimonious attitude. They were of the opinion that the book became a classic only because of historical reasons. Looking at it dispassionately, I have to agree.I was even more interested in the negative comments on those reviews. Most people were angry at the reviewer because they had the temerity to criticise Anne, A HOLOCAUST VICTIM, for God's sake! Whatever be the quality of her writing, the consensus was that the author was a saint and therefore above any kind of criticism. This viewpoint seems to me rather silly - anything published for general consumption is open to both positive and negative reviews.The second most common comment was that this was the diary of a teenaged girl, and never meant to be read for its literary merits - and I do agree with this. Those who criticise based on the quality of the writing is missing the mark, I feel. As with any diary, its primary merit is as a first-hand account of an important period in history.I read it when I was roughly Anne's age. I could visualise for myself the claustrophobic nature of their apartment, and I wondered at a regime which forced a certain section of its citizens to hide themselves in fear of death. This was my first serious exposure to Holocaust literature: and it built in me a passion for history and a lifelong antagonism to fascism of any kind.This was an important book in my life.
