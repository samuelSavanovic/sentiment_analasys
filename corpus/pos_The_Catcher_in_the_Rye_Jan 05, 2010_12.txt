Did you know that Mark David Chapman, who killed John Lennon, held this book, The Catcher in the Rye, while he was arrested? He ''remained at the scene reading J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye until the police arrived and arrested him. Chapman repeatedly said that the novel was his statement.'' - Source Well, I did not know. Not until our English teacher introduced us the book and I had to make some research on it, that is. I learned curious facts about the novel and author (had to watch a documentary on his life) before starting the read, and I cannot tell you how excited I was to start it.I really hope I won’t disappoint anyone by saying this, but I will not write a review this time. See, to tell you the truth, I am in this P.E.I. profile and we are evaluated (in every class) by criterions, which means that I had to do six different oral presentations on this classic and so had to analyze everything orally.Nonetheless, there is this one quote from the book I can’t get out of my mind and want to share with you:(While dancing with some girl.)She was really good. All you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we sat down. That’s the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they’re not much to look at, or even if they’re sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.heheheheI may not have given you my thoughts on this novel, but I am open to hear yours, as always!
